import Guess from "./Guess/Guess"

Game:

The Game Component 
- Picks a random word from 'data.js' and uses `sample()` from utils.js to generate a random word on page load.
- The Game Component renders the GuessInput component

The GuessInput Component
- Renders a form with a text input for the user to enter a 5 letter word. 
- When the user enters characters, this triggers the onChange event which declares a variable `nextGuess` and sets it's value to the user's input (uppercased). 
- The onChange event also updates the state of tentativeGuess to the value of `nextGuess`

- When the user presses enter, `handleSubmit()` is called 
- `handleSubmit()` 
    - Prevents the form from being submitted.
    - Instead, `handleSubmit()` calls `handleSubmitGuess()` and clears the input.

`handleSubmitGuess()` 
- is a function passed down from Game component via props
- It takes the value of the "guess" and adds it to `nextGuesses[]` 
- Then it updates the state of `guessess` to the value of `nextGuesses[]`.
- It then checks the user's guest to see if it matches the answer and updates the state of `gameStatus` to "won" or "lost". 
    - If `gameStatus` is "won" the WonBanner component is rendered with the `numOfGuesses` it took the user to win.
    - If `gameStatus` is "lost" the LostBanner component is rendered with the true answer.

The GuessResults Component
- The GuessResults Component is passed the `guesses` and `answer` props from the Game Component.
- It maps through each guess (up to 6 guesses which is capped by `NUM_OF_GUESSES_ALLOWED` from constants.js ) and outputs a Guess Component for each guess. 

The Guess Component
- The Guess Component compares the value of guess with the answer using the `CheckGuess()` provided by Gituhub from the `game-helpers.js`.
- Next, it renders a Cell Component for each of the guesses. It also renders cells for each try regardless if there's a value. 

The Cell Component
 - The Cell Component takes in `letter` and `status` props from `game-helpers.js`to provide the status for each letter based on the result provided from checkGuess function.
 - A new variable is created for `className`. If a status exists, the value of  `className` is set to `cell` and `status`. Otherwise, the value is set to only `cell`. This is then used as the className value when the Cell Component returns a span for each cell with or without a letter. These classes determine whether or not the cell is green to indicate a correct letter and placement,  yellow to indicate correct letter but incorrect placement, or grey to indicate neither letter or placement are correct.
